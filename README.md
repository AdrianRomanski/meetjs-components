# 🇵🇱 Meet.js Components

**Framework-native Design Systems. Community-powered Web Components.**

An open-source initiative by the Polish Meet.js community to explore 
how **framework-specific design systems** can serve as the foundation for **reusable Web Components**.

---

## Vision

In every modern frontend framework, the way we style, structure, and compose components varies. 
Meet.js Components embraces this diversity by building:

- 🧩 A **dedicated design system per framework** (Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, Qwik, Solid, Vanilla)
- ⚙️ A **shared foundation of accessibility and interaction logic**
- 🔄 A **path toward compiling these systems into native Web Components**

This project celebrates the flexibility of modern tools while converging toward **framework-agnostic UI**.

---

## Goals

- 💡 Encourage framework-specific **design system thinking**
- 🎨 Use each system’s idioms (e.g., Signals in Angular, React Hooks, Vue Composition API)
- 📦 Build storybook-driven libraries per framework
- 🔧 Create **Web Components** from shared tokens, logic, and component blueprints
- 🤝 Enable cross-team collaboration on real-world, accessible components
